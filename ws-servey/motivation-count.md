as a traveler, I want to be able to plan my trip. insights on places to stop along the way to work the roses, detours and route changes, bike shops and stores for repairs and supplies, available in my app even in the absence of cell service and with a strong emphasis on preserving battery. I'd also like an SOS function in case of mechanical troubles that would send a blanket mayday notification to nearby members
a beautiful mix of all of the above :)

I am new to warmshowers, but not to couchsurfing in general. Although my circumstances don't allow me to host, I look to these sites to provide me with an opportunity to meet and share with folks in the places I visit. I don't mind the idea of paying for warmshowers (or whatever alternative), but I'm not going to pay up front just to try it out and find it (possibly) lacking.
I am looking forward to use it as a guest as well in future
I am living in a van. And sometimes its it nice to have a warm shower
I also like to use it to make new friends, and I strongly believe there should be more things for free in this world, more kindness and more support. I have hosted a lot of people and I have stayed with many people.
