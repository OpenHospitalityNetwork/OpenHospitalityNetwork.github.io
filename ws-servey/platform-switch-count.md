This is the very first time that I am using Warmshower and I truly admire this way of doing.
until now I was happy with warm showers, but now I'm in trouble through your message - not happy about the new introduced monthly contribution for the mobile app
probably do both
probably both, the new and old warmshowers
never been part
maybe i will use both
homecamper
can I stay with warmshowers and join (but not "change to") a new app?
Yess i would join the new platform
Yes
Would you consider switching to a new platform?
Wollte es jetzt das erste mal nutzen
Why not. Options are cool.
Warmshowers was being exploited by a non-touring local homeless person masquerading as a cycle tourist. I was able to determine his history by accessing his social media. He was not being honest with me so I denied him hospitality.
Warmshowers rules. Im just not paying for the app
Warmshowers isn't really user-friendly. If another app is made, I'll use it for sure but maybe in combination with ws
Une appli aussi en francais svp
The look of the platform is a bit outdated but works well
Stay on WS and join a new group as well 
Selon proposition
Same as CS. Were good, became profiters. Better make growup an existing platform as Bewelcome or TR.

Pains of organizations.... Thank You for reaching out and taking risk.
Or something for every slow travelers with the same principle as warm shower
Or should be all unmotorized, cyclists, hikers, canoe, horses etc
Nous sommes contents avec WarmShower, même  si nous avons jusqu'à ce jour uniquement accueilli des personnes et n'avons pas pu nous rendre chez des hôtes (famille de 5 personnes,  c'est compliqué...). mais si une autre plateforme est disponible, il est tout à envisageable de s'y inscrire.
Not mutually exclusive. But when meeting new ws people, we I will be happy to redirect
No se que es trustrooths
Never used any but very keen to try
Never any of these platforms. First time on WarmShowers
N/A
M'he interessat vàries vegades per WS, sense arribar-ne a formar part. Per això no puntu-ho més d'un 3, ni bé, ni malament, no puc opinar, més enllà de que la idea de grup i compartir em sembla genial, he fet petits viatges amb la família, però amb la menuda de tres anys no hem fet masses km, i a dormir a casa. Per mi, si ja existeix una plataforma que ens pugui albergar, i COMPLEIXI ELS CRITERIS BÀSICS de la fundació de WS, ho aprofitaria, fer grups nous és separar, diversificar i perdre'ns entre milers d'App's. Gràcies i a partir d'ara estaré amb vosaltres.
Just started researching and found this.
Joining Trustroots
Joined/Used WS in 2018, not sure of current state but open to change
Joined and paid a few days ago cannot access site...hosting a traveler tonight...
Je veux garder un mode d'échange et de partage gratuit
Je souhaite retrouver la même communauté WS, tout simplement
Je ne sais pas. Jamais utilise pour l'instant.
Its already got so many people available for hosting hard to leave that
It's sad that I didn't get any requests from travellers in over a year now. I'd like more if a community
It is very important to me that these exchanges/help/meeting stays free and that people with less money are not exclude of this platform.
It is the first time that I participate in these platforms
Im not a huge cyclist, in fact, in Malta I only cycled for a couple of months living here because cars cant cope and its dangerous, and only did one tour, so my experience is limited. I want to do more tours and learn more along the way.
Im new at warmshowers
Im happy with Warmshowers but feel it is not for me in its present direction
Ik never used the app
If I had to play I wouldn't use it anymore I guess. Think about different countries, of course in Switzerland 30€ Is Not the same as in Portugal, just let it free!!
I,ve not used WS just yet but it has been recommended to me
I've not yet used Warm Showers, so this is all new to me.
I've not recognized unpleasant developments on warmshowers, yet.
I've never used Warm Showers yet, but use Couchsurfing. Something like that but for those travelling with bikes would be amazing.
I'm sure
I'm quite new an I haven't had the chance to see the old page. I had good experience with COUCHSURFING but I start a bicycle tour to Istanbul this year. Send me some stickers an I will share them everywhere.
I'm not happy with this new pay aspect but value its usefulness
I'm not happy with WS
I'm new in this field, a friend told me about this app
I'm happy with the principles etc. The ease of use/ reliability of software; I'm not so sure.
I'm happy to use multiple platforms... Though it's less convenient.
I'm already on trustroots.
I'll take advantage of all opportunities
I'll probably use all of these depending on the country...
I'll join anything that really works
I'll consider to join to trustroots.org, I hope that they website will be as good as warmshowers.org, or even better..
I'd use the option that cares for community and ecology/environment
I'd switch if I had to pay for it, because I am mainly hosting and thus helping to keep the spirit alive.
I'd rather continue with warmshower, but only if it retains its essence.  I'm waiting for the new platform
I'd like to know more about the direction of the board. i haven't been so active in the past couple of years so I'm not in the loop. But the last few emails from them especially regardijg apps have 100% rubbed me the wrong way. glad you're doing something about that it and it sounds like you tried communicating with them. I would be curious about your communication with them and wonder if you can make that public.
I'd like the new platform to be welcome to foot travelers and other human powered transport.
I'd like a platform that does not aim to be a brand. No "we are the community"-stuff. I'd' also host hikers If they are serious about really walking long distances. No backpackers...
I would try the New Service
I would theoretically use another site too but not leave WS
I would stay on warmshowers but prefere a new group pur bike orientated en plus.
I would say the more platforms the better especially when they are community orientated
I would probably use all platforms available simultaneously
I would prefer a dedicated platform, but I understand it's not easy, so I wouldn't mind joining an existing one.
I would lovw to see warm showers free for all or a new platform
I would love the platform to be both cyclists and hikers. We do both...
I would like to return to a free website and application in order to permit to everyone to be able to be part of it. 
I would like a new platform with great values ​​of inclusiveness, freedom, a large and lively community as well as a light and functional application (or other means of interconnection)
I would like a new organisation to include hikers becasue often im hiking rather than cycling. I have become a Welcome to my garden host but it lacks the feedback option  which i beleive offers some security for host and guest. Welcome to my garden does not require any information about host of guest and that causes anxiety- i want to know who will be in my home and about my buisness premises.
I would join an application for all kind of traveller's
I would change to something new but.... I am in a wheelchair, I don't cycle, I do handbiking and wheeling. Please don't exclude those who use 4 wheels every day.
I would change to something new but also stay on ws since this is the biggest platform atm
I would change to something new
I was completely unaware of these underlying changes until I opened the app that you developed. Therefore I was completely happy with thr situation as I thought it to be. The community built on trust and giving is what Warmshowers is all about if you ask me. A paid app gives a very different image to the foundation.
I want to use it as an addition to other platforms platforms
I think guests/ hosts should clearly state their vaccination status.
I simply wish to be part of a cycling community and offer and recieve the best hospitality
I share your point of view about a platform free, democratic and open to contribute
I never used WarmShowers but I don't like the direction it is taking.
I never use it but...
I might use both. Depends on the number of hosts
I might join something new and still keep warmshowers, at least for now.  I just won't support them with volunteering and donations any more
I loved WS when I used it as a guest years back. I'm unaware unaware of new changes.
I live in a bike-unfriendly country and mostly tramp(=hike) these days. Not sure how much more touring I'll do.
I just found out about your org today from friends who recommended you. I amnew to cycling in France. I  am open to change. And  i have l Iife experience working with NP orgs and the frustration with so-called lesdership and boards of directors. I thank you for trying to bring innovation  crestivity to a new endeavor.
I haven't toured for a while, so was unsure that you need to pay now. 30 dollars doesn't seem bad for a lifetime subscription, but I am fully behind keeping the platform free and will support the development of a new, free app.
I haven't hosted or traveled using warm showers in a couple years so maybe it has changed since then?   But last I used it, I found it to be an awesome service and was very happy with it.  I would definitely try out trustroots as well though and might switch to that if I like it better.
I haven't been able to log in since about March 1st, and no response back yet.  I just don't know what happened.  Now I see your message and am wondering.  I am saddened .
I have used warmshowers in the past with other member, but tried to rejoin lately and was unable too, so a new platform foe touring cyclists would be highy appreciated
I have only peaked at WarmShowers in the past, but I'm looking to become a more active participant in cycle touring.
I have barely used the platform, but was available as a host for many years and would like to know there was something available when I needed it.
I had wonderful experiences with Warmshowers.org. I would also be ready to pay a small amount for it (not 30 e !) but I don’t like the fact that people who are only hosting have to pay. Especially in countries where people have lower incomes. It’s impossible to ask them that !
I dont use warmshower yet
I dont know much about cyclists circle - could join if i knew more?
I dont Know trustroots. Right box i am only Host on warmshower.
I don't like that it is becoming unusable for people with limited $$$
I don't know yet
I don't know any of these platforms...
I don't know WS, just heard about it recently
I don't agree with a monthly contribution for the use of the App. I like to give a voluntary donation.
I cannot use welcome to my garden dot org it does not display on my browser but it's not a newest one indeed
I can't give an answer because I new.
I been with WS foe LOTS of years
I am new to touring
I am new to this app. Haven't much feedback to give.
I am new member, just download the app and i am filling the camps of this aplication form for registering myself.
I am new and do not know the organisation yet.
I am happy woth Warm Showers, but agree with everything mentioned at the top of this survey, transparency and democratic decision making is important to me.
I am happy
I am a brand new user of this kind of platform. Don't know too much about WS.
I am (what I consider) an honorary cyclist, in that I am a runner who travels across countries while pushing a stroller (hence my self-appointed honorary role). I have had mixed results. Some,rightfully so, disagree with a non-cyclist using the site (my profile very clearly stated my mode of transport, so there was no subterfuge on my part), but others were welcoming, based on the spirit of the platform. I liked my experiences on WS, but if I may put in my two cents worth, perhaps the new platform might formally welcome ALL self/human-propelled travellers.
How about joining or being part of the BeWelcome
Hofheim am Taunus
Have not used before. Can't tell.
For me it is most important that a platform I am using is free of charge.
Facilidad de búsqueda
FFS - best would be to cover all grounds no, there is no benefit of the new if the reach/adoption is marginally irellevant.
Every other plateform in the same spirit
Eugene
Don't know yet!
Don't know cyclist trust circle, will look into it.
Disappointed that it is not a free site anymore
Difficult to change from something that works with a huge community to something new starting from scratch...
Didn't know of WS before, wanted to try it now
Both is alright for me
Bedingt durch die corona Pandemie leider kaum Erfahrungen gemacht
Bad guests twice
As you said in your entrance words.
As a occasional user I don't get in touch with the things happening in the background
Apenas baje la aplicacion con la intencion de ser parte de esto
Always open to alternatives
Also BeWelcome is another great platform which already has a big community. And cyclists groups are probably already existing.
After about more than 6 ou 8 years as host and guest on Warmshower I noticed different evolution. You're talking about staff and team objectives and you're probably right. I saw deep and strong modifications in the way people are traveling. And I'm sad to write that cycling touring way of mind is fucked up. It became too fast, too superficial, less and less respect from guest for host..... so I'm not able at that moment to imagine how a new site or application will change things.
After Couchsurfing did change to bad i hope you can manage to stay free
A small fee after using the app is no problem. 1 or 2 euro every meeting
