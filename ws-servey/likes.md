# What do you like about WarmShowers.org?
(after 2773 responses)

The mission and large number of hosts.
cyclists only focused
it's got a lot of people on it, and had very good experiences with the people on there
The original Idea.
The community. First mover advantage will be super hard to get over in a new platform.
Exactly the reasons you outline above and in your farewell communication. Also, when something becomes monetized it changes the very nature of it and attracts those with different expectations. 
Possibility to meet cyclists all over the world as guests, as hosts. To find persons in the regions who can help with local informations about cycling there..
Nothing
Great hosts, easy to use service
All
Good experience  so far, nice people
It's couchsurfing for bicycle travellers.
Search by Google Maps
I can find very friendly hosts - thank you :) 
All the contacts I have had in the last 2 years
It is free
The opportunity to share, meet other bike travelers, to give and receive.
The entire system, map,... 
Large community, welcoming and friendship
Very smart
Je suivrai les fondateurs de WS m√™me sur un autre site MERCI !!!
The open phone book mentality. Wherever I am. Let's call the next cycling enthusiast
the people using it
Simple 
I love Warmshowers. Such a great way to meet awesome people... That's outside of the money system and built on the gift economy. Totally a fan and have had many great experiences that make me think humans are good and the world is good. Super sad to it go.... Not sure of what the internal politics are but it's been great as a user. Please keep it going or make an alternative! The world needs it! 
Free
Simply concept. Make everybody to travel freely.
Free and easy to contact people
very friendly hosts, hosting people, awesome talks, spontanous stays, nice app, it is just great

Altruism, meeting other cycle tourists
Nice people
C'est nouveau pour moi 
The simplicity and the people on the app :) 
Very open-minded relaxed genuinly helpful people 
"Free of charge
"
The fact that it was cyclists oriented and as usually cyclists travel with their camping gears it was giving the possibility for more ppl to open their garden without involving ppl to completely open their house when they don't necessary feel comfortable about it. A first step to make ppl trust more in other humans.
It enables me to meet the people who like bicycles and like travelling
It's the original and free but with donations

I have only been a member for a short time. So far I am amazed about the openness of people and the hospitality people have given to us. I only had great contacts with very nice people.

Open friendly group.
The hospitality of the hosts and the possibility of exchanging experiences 
So far I didn't use it much and my place wasn't used much either. As far as I used it, I liked it because of the convenience to have a good place to sleep and relax and meet nice hosts.
To be able to get in contact with biclycler all over the world. To know a bit about them before arriving. To give and to receive.
Feeling of community, available for everyone + The map to see where people live

Meet very different people at home, get informations in my smartphone everywhere
Basically the app works well most of the time and connects me as a bike traveller and host to all the other travellers and hosts. The later app additions (newsletter, etc) are nice but not really necessary.
How it is open-minded compared to Couchsurfing, the fact that you can choose hosts from a map
I like to know people
Only for bicycles
Easier messages exchange, see easily Who is available or connected soon

"It's open and easy to use, as we can see on the map who's free, view reviews and thus have more info.
The app was quite easy to use during a travel bike. "
It brings like minded people together. I feel that when I go touring there are friends who I have not yet met waiting to welcome me, to support me and to help me.

Free app
I would like it free, simple, open source
I consider it a safe page, both for travelers and hosts.  that each user has a status and can leave comments is essential.  I think it is the ideal platform for those of us who decide to open the doors of our home selflessly to others

Connecting with bike and adventure lovers
"I did like that it was uncomplicated and that the hosts could publish their mobile number, together with the location on the map (something that used to be possible on couchsurfing but isn't any more). Searching by map was an essential feature.
Everytime I hosted or stayed at someone's through warmshowers, I was sure that they were open- and likeminded. "
Meeting people, being a host, resting after bicycling in a cosy place, advice from locals about roads, campings, restaurants etc.

It is now recognized across the world.
Help people who are travelling. Know new persons and new cultures. Share good moments. Be human. 
the community of welcoming people
Usefull
That it is specific about cyclists, which makes it somehow more effective and trustworthy.
The concept is very good, providing that members can trust each other.
"I have to say that I have not bothered to be involved in the politics of the organisation. I have hosted about 40 cyclists in my home since joining five years ago and have been a n appreciative guest on half a dozen occasions. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 
I am definitely open to being a member of a further cyclists hosting organisation however."

I am so confused I was about to donate and then I went on the app. Is warm showers closing down or is it just the app?
The people I met
That it is free and does not collect a using fee, although i don't know if this is still the case. Has been a while since I've been on warmshowers due to covid
That the vast majority of people on the site are bike tourists, so the conversations are more informed, interesting, and memorable.
Large community.
I really really want to keep keep the spirit of warmshowers alive, but not if that means it becomes a business !! What I love about this community is the spirit of openness and being of the same family of travelers, and I don't think I would find that on any other platform, so please !!!! Create something new, we will follow !!!!!! Dont give up !!
All about it, the concept

Su popularidad
The easy Handling
The cultural exchange and offering of accommodation which I have enjoyed for the last 20 years
La posibilidad de contactar con personas que tienen el mismo deporte en com√∫n 
It gives an opportunity to find a place to sleep in more populated areas. I'm happy enough sleeping in the woods when there are woods to sleep in, but cities can make that tricky, which is where warmshowers comes in.
Community feel
World wide, well known
Possibility to know other people.
it is exclusive to traveling cyclists only
I like that is free, because that allows to many people to join,  also I really love to meet new people from different cultures and I really enjoy to hear their stories traveling around the world.

Just the same I would like the Cs account back, quantity. But the same I have no FB, I can live without them.(lived before internet also)
I like how it used to be, uncomplicated to contact people; and not money orientated.

 the  lifelong friendships  with guest or host .. "
Free exchange between cycliste people

It's still so much better than what couchsurfing became...
The principal it was founded upon
I really haven't used it enough. Convenience and simplicity are good
Idea speaks for itself
being able to contact people I wouldn't ordinarily be able to
The community 
As i joined few years ago i like the fact that I don't have to pay a fee, but afraid it might change. But i don't like that some of my friends and people i meet on the way and that thanks to me heard about WS, they can't join as the fee it's quite high
Don't know
It's easy!
Meeting cyclotourers !
It's working and even if the community is small, all people there are great.
The large community
Easy to use
Better than CS as we share a same passion together
I've used it as a guest and hosted a lot, it was fun. I don't know the insides but it works for me. 
Many of the things already mentioned plus another option when planning my cycle tours. 
To continue and to developpate

That's it is specifically for bicycle touring
"To get information, which you only get from locals. Like:

- can you recomend a bike repair shop in your town
-whats the best way to get from A to B by bike
- is there a good place to set up my tent "

People knows what we need when we bike travel. The community is great and is known everywhere in the world. Only good vibe
Hospitality
Flexibiliyeit
It scratched a specific itch that sites like airbnb just want to capitalize on. Free accommodations for like-minded folks.
Got thrown off warmshowers after 9 years of being a host by Tahverlee Anglen, the 'CEO' as she describes herself, for daring to ask who she was. Allegedly she's simply using the site to milk the donations into her own pocket.
I liked it was free. What I liked the most was to be able to see the addresses on the map.

I loved all my experiences on warmshowers, mostly because hosts where incredible generous and knew exactly what I needed. I am gay and always travel with my husband. I face prejudice and homophobia all the time in small different ways, but this never happened while cycling and using warmshowers. It was the love for cycling and touring that was the most important thing.
The free meeting ans sharing
The possibility of meeting like minded people. 
Diversity of options and that it is specific for cyclists. It is possile to go quickly through the other people's profile before asking something or receiving someone at your home.

Ability to meet amazing people occasionally. Locals when travelling or world tourers when hosting. Just amazing stories. 
I like the uncomplicated way to get a shower and to meet other like- an open minded people.

The fellowship of the open road.
The community it stands for
I like the idea. 
Meeting people.
Cultural exchange; talking with other bicycle tourists about shared and unique experiences; helping to make it easier for folks to travel by bike. 
The large community
I love everything about WarmShowers. It has helped so much going on bicycle tours, not only that but as well with meeting amazing/beautiful human-beings. And with the help with others, it always made me want to reflect the same energy back to those who needs help as well with no charge. As long as they are safe and return the same favor. Thank you so much for being an amazing app. But most importantly, being beautiful human-beings you ladies and gentlemen are. 
The ability to easily connect cyclists to hosts.
I haven't used the application yet, but I would look forward to seeing it be functional again for future bike trips.
Huge network
I have hosted for 12+ years meeting hundreds of interesting wonderful people
The community 
Hosting, being accomodated and thus cultural exchange
Found hosts to be much more spontaneous than those on couch surfing, and willing to help. But: lack of contact options occasionally, uncertainty who was available or not.
Meeting people
Free, easy

"The way how I got aware of the site.
Someone I met on the road during a travel. 
I think the moment something gets popular and a broader audience, it just loses it's charm. Warmshowers is/was a cyclist thingy. That's what I liked. "
Help and exchange between bike lovers
Meeting People from everywhere and help for free. This is for free so no pressure if this is not perfect.
the large user base of hosts and guests
even without actually using it to to travel or host, or as a social platform, I liked that I could see that there are a lot of like-minded folks around.
Simplicity and exchange
I like to connect with cycle tourists. I enjoy meeting people from all over the world who share a passion for cycling. I do get vicarious pleasure from hearing about others travels,and I enjoy giving the cyclists I host insites about this community. 
"It's about cycling. It's quite simple.
You can get the phone number from people.
You could reply direct through email."
Free and facility
The precious community and friends I've made through warmshowers.
I only had people stay over at my place twice, and they were very nice.
It's free!
Connecting cycle tourists and making cycle touring cheaper by the host/guest method.
Like minded cycling People, friendly and carefull. The review you have to Write. 
dedicated and exclusive to bicycle tourers and free app
It works, easy to use, the messages to contact members.
Connectivity between tourers and hosts
Honestly I've never had to use the app for myself,  but i feel safe knowing I have a resource for emergencies.
The community is everything.  I just want to be able to browse for a place to stay and share mine with fellow cyclists, but I can't pay a $20 subscription to show that I am open to host.
The map! I like to see the general vicinity of where people are at. Example: NYC is a big ads city. Are they in the bronx or Staten Island or Queens? Very relevant information when traveling. Oklahoma City is massive, so is Mumbai India. Its nice to see the general vicinity of those hosting. 
The ability to find places to stay while bike touring, and ability to pay it back/forward by housing others looking for the same
Solely dedicated to touring cyclists only
It's cycling specific. It's got a name people trust. People have been there for a very long time so it's reputable.
The concept
I like the idea of it. Cyclists hosting and guesting
I never got to fully experience WS but had meant to try it for years. Looking to sign up this year, I noticed it wasn't free - which made no sense to me. I instead have been discovering friends of friends accommodation through social media, which was okay while in the UK, but I'm hoping to ride further from home!
The chance to meet other cyclists, to easily find them, contact them, to read reviews so you know what to expect, know that your hosts are thrustworthy. 
Direct contact
The community
Free exchange and services
Interaction with many host who have been in your position
Always met great people 
Good people
Free and helpful reviews. Easy to find who hosted in the locations I was interested in
Nice community , security of relations with ratings.
Everything
That again is an opportunity in an emergency to stay hygienic and have accommodations
Meeting people from everywhere and seeing new bikes
Free platform to get in touch with people when travelling, or host other travellers
Large network of kind people who relate to bike travel and like to help others experience better
I met nice people and save money
Simplicity
The community
nice community and people, no profit orientation (well at least previously)
Only bicycle travelers
Connecting with people all over the world by hosting. Have been a guest a few times but don't have time to travel right now.
The idea instantly appealed to me as showers and readily available access to clean water was what I missed most while travelling by bike.
That it connects people from all over the world, providing unique experiences.
The I don't have to pay to be a host
The community and the people I met thanks to it.
Melding bikers wirhout money involved
Easy tonuse
exchange of experience. And making new friends 
Ease of finding hosts and contacting them, nice to have a few guests from time to time. 
It's world wide, easy to use
Easy to use
Meeting other enthusiasts 
It was new when I joined, I like the idea of hosting people who are traveling and offer them a safe place and a meal.
Getting in touch with other tour bikers
Connecting with other cyclists.
Becoming too commercial
Good people.
Large international network. Relatively easy to use
Right now, inactive due to the fees
The community and meeting like minded people
Simplicity and conviviality
An wonderful idea
Can't see some negative.
The occasion to meet locals
It provides accommodation for like minded people
User friendly 
I met delicious people from other side of the planet 
The straightforward approach about it: I am travelling by bike, I need a cheap place to stay and I am not indirectly forced to approach my host as the coolest person on earth I definitely have to meet. Couch-Surfing which somehow grew into a bloated facebook for "cool young people from all over the world" didn't make me comfortable with beeing straightforward.
That is is free and easy to access, so there is no hurdle to just trying it out. Before I tried, it seemed too good to be true,  and I wouldn't have paid anything to try it out, but it was true!
It's easy to use, great community
Free, nice people, uncomplicated
Chill
Bike tour focus, phone numbers available for contacting
A comprehensive list of hosts across almost all countries. You know when you are hosted the person will know what you need and there still always be some good stories to share.
Wonderful people I've met
C'est une plateforme plus confidentielle et plus s√©rieuse que le couchsurfing.
I like that it is affordable for all. It provided a feedback process for both hosts and guests that seemed accurate, and reliable. It was easy to access.
It's so welknown among cycle toerists
"Open culture without obligations
"
The community. People are so welcoming and accommodating
The big community, the travel stories. I was host of really nice guests. 
Easy top handle
The members
The community, easier to find hosts than cochsurfing.  To host people and hang out/help them.
You can find and stay with likeminded people
It's practice
Offer and get a place with likeminded people
Bien connu en France, il y avait beaucoup d'h√¥tes (en comparaison des autres applications). En syst√®me simple de mise en relation.
Easy to manage. Maps helps easily to find out place to stay. Peuple WE hosted were all or them very.kind and share stories and hobbies.
it is/was just what it is/was built for. No couchsurfing.com.
Meeting people
To meet cyclists from the whole World and to cycle with less money. All
easy possibility to meet cyclists as host as well as guest
C'est une plateforme facile √† utiliser . Par contre, cette plateforme doit rester gratuit! Cela doit rester un moyen d'√©changes (proposition d'h√©bergement ou accueil d'h√©bergement) pour tous
The philosophy regarding a free and open  Network of bicycle tourers and people who   Are willing to open their home to Someone they don't even know. 
Big community
I like the community of bike tourer and meeting other people who love bike touring
Simple and nice 
Direct contact via phone number
The trust and openness of hosts. How they leave their phone number and I can contact them on the same evening because it started raining and I want a dry place to stay. How responsive people are, not like couchsurfing where hosts get requests all the time and don't always answer your messages, or that you need to plan in advance. I like having a map.
The idea to travel an meet people, the kindness and good heart of everyone that open the doors to me. Actually, the environment around the world, it doesn't care the language you speak, you can feel it.
The basic idea 
That it is only for cyclist, not like coachsurfing for anybody. I didn t follow the changes because I didn t travel the last year. I would not pay for the service, I liked that it was a non profit volunteer organization
Bicycle focus. Great people
Meeting people from different cultures.  Sharing.
The cultural exchange and meeting people with similiar passion of cycling
Connects awesome people together
We have met some lovely people.
Makes cycle touring easier
It is the only source I know of for finding places to stay on tour. 
Meeting like-minded cyclists
I'll find many nice people
The commuity of hosts and travellers
I have been a guest last year in many peoples homes... That is just incredible... Now I am a host. However I pity that it is half payed service now.
Free accomodation. Meet the people. Free space for my tent.
The spirit of sharing, welcoming and helping others
It's easy to contact p√©riple when they put their phone number
I have only great experiences with it
Being able to find warm safe places to stay, shower and camp. Meet awesome like minded people and friends 
The warmshower minset from the beginning. I cycle 16000km, i have so many good m√©moires, free and strong memories
App on phone
Not free too bad 
Friendship
The platform has established during the years and is known worldwide. It should be free OR have a 1 time subscription that would last for a lifetime.
A platform dedicated only to cyclist
It's free and easy 
meeting people
Hosting and staying
It was free
I haven't used much yet, but i really appreciate the idea. 
Host map - It's free - It's only a chat with no fees - Exchange with other bikers - Security 
The map option..
As a host and a user since 2012 I think it's great to meet new people around the world with similar interests 
Keep it free for the riders! (And of course for the hosts).
Haven't used it.  Considering a cross country trip and was thinking of using it
Meet
Exchange
It is a great idea 
A good idea 
simplicit√©,honesty,culturale aspect,without any Monet exchange
The people you meet
Well back in the day I had some fabulous hostings, and hope to do so again very shortly
The spirit found when I have used it.
I used the when I travelled across country by bike and it was awesome.  I am not really aware of the board changes too much and with the pandemic, I have not been travelling or hosting.  If the new platform maintains the original intent and maintains some assurance of safety, then I'm all in.
community
I want to continue supporting fellow traveler cyclists and making friends on the route, but without paying
The original concept
"There is plenty of possibilit√©s to rest at People places.
I also  like the  intercultural exchanges"
To meeting people who have th√© same mentality
The community
Meeting nice cicle People and giffing hospitality and trust People
The big community very open minded and welcoming!
The idea of a free and safe place to stay while getting to know locals
"it's free, no money ...
"
Quite easy to use
Everything
The community isn't too big. It is trustfull, simple, and people you meet through this plateform share the same spirit (I compare  with couchsurfing, where you can't find the same thing)
Free accommodation
The original idea.
I like the idea to offer something to a guest (shower, hospitality, bed, meal)
It has connected me to some wonderful people
It's convenient when you can stay somewhere for free and be with like minded people.
The map, local people based approach
Many hosts
not much to like about the present setup and governance.
Great host and guests so far for me 
I'm just trying it now 
The community
The opportunity to host and sleep by people 
All my experiences were lovely 
Its friendly interface
The app is easy to use and makes getting in touch easy.
To be in relation with other cyclists which whom I share common values of hospitality and who know how it feels to be on the roads.
Website is still free, tho buggy. I've met wonderful people thru WS and have enjoyed both guesting and hosting.
When I used it in 2018/2019 I liked that I was able to meet other cyclists and locals to the area, staffing with them in a very communal way. A much more personal feel than staying in an air bnb
Simple
Meeting some people, exchanging tips and stories, spending wonderful time together...
I like the high density of possible accomodations 
used to like the community spirit
Meeting and staying as a guest with like-minded cyclists while I am on the road touring by bike. I want to host other traveling cyclists, but my home is not on any popular bike route so there is not too much oppurtunity for that.
The profiles and that the persons have to describes therselfs.
I've never used it, but many people recommend it. 
not complicated, community, save, friendly, easy. (i didn't use it for 4 years..so speak for then)
The intension is good. People are good. I would expect more facilities in the app.
Perhaps the only one app for cycling comunity to live & cycle
The ability to connect with open-minded and friendly people.
warm showers has saved my sorry behind dozens of times. whether I'm caught in a storm have mechanical mishaps, can't find a place to camp, or simply need a shower and or laundry, I have been able to find someone on the app, seriously, dozens of times.
Hosting and being hosted by like minded people
I like the spirit of it. I have discovered it in late 2012 and been host in my country and guest when traveling.
The large community 
Maps and easy Access to hosts
The spirit of human hospitality and sharing
The past free use, and all the idea
Know people
That is full of cyclist aware of the needs of the travelers
I liked and used a lot, very good experiences
Uniqueness
I have no problem with $25 a year
Finding a dray and safe place to spend the night+ having the possibility to take a shower. Nice is for guests and host that they can mention the possibilities of infrastructure that is available.
Proximity
Easy way to find a place to stay + get in touch with amazing people. Fast communication and response of the people. 
Easy

patricities in meeting new bicycle travelers and cultures and economy in travel comfort and safety.
It was well know.  You could find people all around the world. 
I liked it, but i am not readying a lot of the stuff they are emailing to us.
"Most useful thing is people's phone numbers being listed. We found they were A LOT better at responding to text/call than email. This feature is crucial for me. 
Message responsiveness metric is useful to know whether to get your hopes up. 
Goes without saying but everybody friendly and helpful, community is the strongest asset of the platform. "
Simple

Everything except when people are not actice for a long time and still stay on the map....maybe they fixed that
Used to be free and easy access, loads of potential hosts, well known platform. Funny name too!
The simplicity of contact. When you're in a cycling trip, you just need a phone number to quickly be able to reach people the day you need or the day before. 
Safe and cool
Le c√¥t√© convivial des √©changes que l'on √† entre voyageurs.
The large choice of hosts all over the world.

Les notations sur les gens que vous recevez ont peu aussi savoir si ses personnes ont √©t√© appr√©ci√© ainsi que les h√¥tes peuvent le faire sur nous 
Th network of alternative ways of staying over
It is only for cyclists and cyclo tourists, free, easy to use (the map is perfect), clear and simple for hosts and guests to understand what is offered and what not.
I haven't used it in several years. I love the idea, but have no particular attachment to warmshowers in particular. 
That it is free and open to everyone!
It's great to meet People!
Free app with easy to use functionalities.  Big network all over the world
Hospitality and community
"I still never use this app, just heard about it, and i think it s a very nice concept!
I looking forward to used it"
Still never used..
hosts who welcomed me in an extraordinary and disinterested way, great discussions all evening. Some of my hosts were organic farmers, and I learned a lot from them (I grew up and live in big city)
Have a look into other cultures (of cycling), feeling universal trust an hospitality. Give and get home.
Easy to use 
That it brings cyclists together. 
Great Team,  great Job!
The possibility to know new friends 
It's pretty straight forward. No muss no fuss and gives a platform for guests and hosts to connect
It's free en meet new people
It was easy to use, and you could use the map fubntuon to find people. It wasn't perfect, but it was also great, and I could find people with numbers or emails and contact them directly. 
Mostly, the idea at its core
It's the first rider Application I ever met
Hosting 
It's reasonably well supported, or was until it started charging.  I don't think a small subscription fee is unreasonable
Its not commercialized
Meet people 
Casualness
Simplicity and freedom
That it unites people with the same interest and understanding of what it is to travel by bicycle. It's more specific than couch surfing as the hosts know bicycle shops, usually have a place to keep your bicycle, understand your need to shower, rest, eat a hot meal, etc.
The size and quality of the community, the likeminded people, the commun interest that gather us all. The filters function
It worksf
The community

Every exchange possible 
The idea 
It suits me and historically done well.
Network 
It has its faults but it is still ok in my opinion
Concept of touring community
Well constructed 
it's very easy to use and it's free
I like what it brings to me as host and guest.  But I would like to keep the platform open for everyone/ not commercial
Bella idea
C'est nouveau je d√©couvre
"The people who use warmshower share the same love for travelling by bike. 
I find the search function via the map very practical and clear. I find the possibility of contacting me even without an app simply via the telephone number very good. The information you can make about the accommodation and so on, are very good and detailed. "
I use it To host and help cyclists mostly. It works...what you are saying is sad.
Meeting other cyclists and sharing our enthusiasm for cycling
It's a cycle touring community, when you accept a request you know you have something to talk about and you know people won't travel by car.
The way, and the platform 
Great memories and connections back when it was free
Interesting people come to my home.

Warm showers was a God send for me when I biked across the country in 2013. Since that time ive gone on a few more tours, and each time warm showers has helped connect me nice folks in the bike trqveling community who are able to bring me in, some essentials like a shower/electricity/shelter, occasionally a meal and some stories, and a free place to stay the night. It's been a special community for me over the years and I feel strongly that it must remain free and as open source as possible.

It helped me meet many fantastic local host in Asia. Now that i'm back home i meet a guest from time to time, it helps keeping the spirit alive. It used to be based on donation, which i think is a fair system.

Connects cyclist and hosts around the world
Oh my goodness! I have been hosted in so many countries by so many, many wonderful and generous people. I didn't even know it was down since we've been in this pandemic for so long and I hadn't travelled. The people I met have been so wonderful! And the money I saved!! I can't even describe it. It is a really wonderful thing...warmshowers.org.
I think its awesome that people would open up there home for a shower, a pee or a cup of tea.

I use it a lot
Nice app
All people who I meet
Just joined so don't have any feedback 
Free, safe travel. The faith in humanity that was restored in me after my first tour. The cultural exchange. Breaking bread with strangers. Sharing stories, encouragement, advice, props, help, and love. Generosity. Flexibility (OK to offer at minimum a place to pitch a tent and shower, or maximally whatever I want to give at that time. I like that everyone knew there was a huge spectrum of what to expect and was grateful for all offerings) I like the reviews and ratings. As a single woman who hosts, this comforts anxiety about inviting strangers over.
Very convenient, being part of a community

I wasn't aware of those commercial developments, I just liked the fact that I could find places to stay over

"As a host:
I feel that when I host travellers there is an adventure coming to my house. The great thing is this can be after a long day of work and even knowing that tomorrow will be another long day at work. I like sharing the traditional dish of my city, letting the travellers update their blogs and wash their clothes while they shower an eat. Usually I prefer people to leave after one night. That's easiest for me.
As a guest:
I really like when I can crash somewhere get the travel stink off me and have some food. I then really like hearing the hosts travel stories. But mostly I'm just tired and want to sleep :)"

ƒ∞t's so useful application, I'm happy meet to local people and spend time with together.
The idea they started with back in 2012
It's free a based on sharing. True sharing not renting a place like a airbnb
Community spirit and the love of cycling 
Knowing it's a large database of like minded people, and you can usually find someone on it from all over the world. Being specifically for bike touring hosts generally understood and anticipated the needs of the guests while touring and after a long day on the bike - something that wasn't the case with other similar platform (e.g. couch surfing)
Well founded community

In the past I have met interesting hosts as well as hosting cyclists. I love that!
Happy to see this initiative!!

Dedicated to cyclists.  Share local knowledge and hospitality.  Share touring stories, location recommendations and bike hacks.

I like that WS builds community amongst self-powered travellers.

Very nice
Nice people, app well designed
I like that its only a cycly community contrary of CS, where ppl are not always aware of what it is to cycle long distance and in need to have advice on the road, shiwer for examples. Sometimes we take more time on the road and can get late at the host who know this can happen because he is also a cyclist. Feel more understanding, support, and i m more trusty to welcome from warmshiwer platform.
It's perfect application i love it

I really liked that you can look for the right places on a map and get to know the address and phone number directly for last minute requests"
The community experience, the people
The conection with other People has like the same thing. This open a lot of oportinities and possibilities for all the guest and the host, from acomodations, and know some information and share culture, that is vert valuable
Todo, si no estuviese la aplicaci√≥n ser√≠a muy caro y dif√≠cil viajar, y las personas que viajan solas nesecitan compart√≠r momentos con otros ciclistas para compart√≠r etc 
I find in warmshowers what disappeared from couchsurfing : human beings with proper behaviour : kindness and respect. Plus, it's exclusive to cyclists, which is something important to me. 
The incredible friendly Community. Never had problems and everyone is super kind. And Just the idea Is brilliant, I adore you developers! Big big up for this, probably you changed the bikepacking world!
I have not used it for 2 years. But before i found it uncomplicated and reliable, people answerd on short notice, everybody knew what cyclists need
This is my impression from when I last travelled in 2016 hosted up till 2019, as I haven't travelled much since (cos you know, pandemic..). I was a guest and a host and I loved it for the same reasons that cyclists all over loved it. Cultural exchange, openness, helping hand, a place to stay. I am now getting back to travelling and there's so much changes on ws! 
Everything
It brings people together.
Community. These things work as a network effect. It has to have good people first (memorable members, by their kindness, fast responses, back stories, unusual location, etc ), and numerous people second. 
Rencontrer des gens
Yes
Opportunity to have a place to stay with like minded people and when possible open our house
Saving money and getting local knowledge. 
Conocer gente y compartir historias de viajes
Whenever planning a trip, I check WS to see where overnight accomodations are available.
Everything until they change their access (free to non free). I had a similar experience with Guest to Guest when they switched to HomeExchange.
It's simple to get in contact, it's non commercoal and it's about cycletouring and nothing else!

I didn't get a chance to use it, but I loved the concept!
La posibilidad de encontrar a personas que me puedan alojar ya que es mi primer viaje como cicloviajera 
Obviously, travelers come in many types, but I feel most comfortable interacting with bicycle tourers, and those who are used to interacting with them. There's always some trust and risk involved with travel, and WarmShowers.org felt like a safer space than others. 
That it's a community solely for bike tourers!
Its friendly

I've met many like minded and wonderful people through this app
Map showing were hosts are. 
Many addresses. Free. (But now I quit.) Sympathetic idea of sharing.
Many users
To get on contact with new people and get the chance to learn more about a city/village by the hosts. Or to show guests more about my village/the city's near by. 
La experiencias vividas reflejadas en los viajeros
A lot of possibility 
That was free and it put together people from all around the world.
Cyclists being there for cyclists
I used it for years and was able to find amazing hosts when I was on tour! And also hosted a couple people. It just felt great to have this free exchange and mutual support to make bike touring financially accessible to all!
"Joined in 2015, when started my own round the world solo female cyclic tour. WS was always beside me as a ""best friend"" I could count on. Never let me down. As much as I love the wild camping, it was so needed to know, the safely is there, I only need to ask for support via WS, anywhere I am on the map. 
And when I had some issues with a particular host (some sexual harrestment in a Muslim country), WS costumer service was ready to jump and help.
That's because you are the best people working behind the scenes at WS.
And I'll always be grateful for that. 
Sad to read of the difficulties and the need to build a new site.  But I'll be there with you.  Love, Renata Marton "
The scale. Many potential people to stay with. Even though many accounts are sleeping, there's always a chance your message pops up and they decide to host you. This makes WS easier to trust on to find places to sleep in stead of using 4 apps at the same time. During travel you want to keep it simple.
A wondeful initiative as long as it continues to  be open transparent and free.  Putting like-minded people in contact. 
Z
I liked it when I joined a few years ago, it seemed like a nice and friendly community and there were no big expectations on me as a host, other than that there was a place to sleep and a warm shower to have.
I used to like them more when they were open and accessible to all. In recent years I like it less
It was simple.  Loved meeting people as a host.
It's honesty 
Es una buena idea 
Community
its free
I'm new

The premise 
i just stumbled upon it but it sounds like a Very wholesome concept
A cycling community willing to share life with others
Before it became commercial it was GREAT
It was simple, a map, messages to host or be hosted and thats it ! 
Meeting folks who have experienced what I have. They understand - far better than couchsurfing.
Being the most famous app for this use, everbybody who bicycletour is on it : there is no need to have several app
The huge possibilities to get a place to sleep during the bike tours. And great to check the host, eg pictures and comments from other guests.
WE have been Host and guest during our bicycle touring: just amazing! Meeting incredible persons!

The community it has built for cyclists. It's essential for bicycle touring and it's affordability. I have so many great memories of people I have met through Warm Showers
The opportunity to meet people, and get a feelgood from helping people as well as having those opportunities to find accommodation.  I really have no issue with paying a 20 dollar subscription when staying at a youth hostel costs about ¬£25 dollars a night.  My issues have been with the "members", those few who are total freeloaders with no intention of hosting, no manners, demanding. Thats why i now ask that people bring their own sleeping bag liner. I am also fed up with people who book abnd do no shows. Yes phone signal issues occurr and hicupps occur but not to apologise even a few days later.  Few members give feedback- teh rfeedback on my profile does not reflect teh guests whom i have had.
I stayed in a really nice place for one night near York. It was easy to organise and free!

"Out of fifty night on the road, I might use WS 3 nights. 
referencing early question, how great is it that there exists a community that opens the door to a stranger. I like also that it is related to cycling long distance on a bike - creates a common ground; typically, I need to clean my gear, repack, prepare for the next day: hosts typically understand this need. Additionally, they know that I am tired after a day or more of riding."
I like the community and the people 
Honestly integrity and good spirit o adventure 
Connecting strangers
Warm people
The idea of an open community of cyclists who understand the struggle of being on the road and willing to give back / pay it forward
It does the job well enough

The message response percentage. Deleting never active accounts. No promise of services other than a camp spot and shower. 
I couldnt log in... had to fill out this survey first.
I met marvelous people. I like the fact that people are cycling like me, that we share the same passion. It‚Äôs a way to meet locals who usually speak English. It‚Äôs a way to sleep in a bed or on a sofa sometimes‚Ä¶
