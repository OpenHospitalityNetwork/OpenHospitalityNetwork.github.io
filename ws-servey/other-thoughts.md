"I had the idea recently that I'd love the next generation of hospex platform to be built in a federated way, perhaps using activitypub. This would allow different groups of people to run their own platform with their own rules, and really addresses the issues with these centralized platforms where the board end up with too much power (I am an ex-trustroots contributor who had some disagreements with the board).
I wrote a bit about the idea here https://social.coop/@nicksellen/105802657064401396"
Can you please ensure that communication over Facebook (another closed platform) is also mirrored somewhere else? (E.g. website/newsletter/etc)
Only my gratitude for your hard work and giving me the opportunity to find a bed from time to time. 
If you create a new platform we would like to have feedbacks for hosts and guests (not so with trustroots, also there profiles are often without informations about persons,...)
I think WS is great and I recommend it wudely
No
Big thumbs up for your initiative! 
Keep it free. Doesn't matter if you add pub
No
Thanks for your idea of building a new global biking network in which every voice counts. Be blessed!

Also even tho you eventually would like to create a new dedicated platform for cyclists. Using the open source code of trustroots and make it that they work kind of the same would maybe help in a way to not have multiple systems working completely differently. Although references/comments are a nice feature.
No
Le principe de warmshower était formidable. 
It'd be great to be able to import previous profiles and references from other hosting platforms like couchsurfing.  
I've been a user and a host and appreciated both.
Well done to split
Thanks a lot to al you volunteers who have worked on the apo/website and everything else! Much appreciated!! 
Thanks you for creating this platform. I had the pleasure to met great people through this. 
I watched WS get more"commercial" with regret but accepted it must be inevitable. I'm keen to go back to the "old days" but not sure if it is possible ....
No
I would like to pay for a membership. Something like €100 per year.
Thank you

Will a new app be able to access / communicate with existing users.
El modelo de mapa de la app está bueno porque se visualiza la geografía.. quizás se podrían agregar algunos datos de altimetría y datos similares del lugar. Además me gusta que la interacción de mensajeria sea simple de utilizar, sin demasiadas opciones interactivas. Creo que también es importante que se usar la app en varios idiomas ya que muchas veces, como en este cuestionario, las páginas solo están disponibles en inglés. Les deseo mucho éxito en este emprendimiento, espero poder utilizar la nueva app muy pronto. Saludos desde Ecuador!
I'm very happy to see that some people remember the real hostility ! And help people to help them each other, thank you for what you did with ws and thanks for the future.
You are awesome for not being another couchsurf and staying true to your principles and transparent to the user!
I could do some advertising for you on my tour through Europe. Send me some stickers or something like that. I drive from Regensburg (Germany) to Istanbul( turkey) 
Please contact me
Muchas gracias 
How to report creepy hosts
Si
This app is very usefull for meeting people abroad.
Appreciate your works you have done and willing to do again/further. I'm from Mongolia and have been ws member over 10 years now.
Maybe some kind of cooperation or coexist with BeWelcome?
My choice of "very unhappy" is primarily due to my volunteering as a developer for the WS platform
Super nice, thanks for the effort to make up something new 👍
How good the hospitality of other cyclo-travelers was on my last trip
Thank you so so much for everything. I have been cycle of touring for 1.5 years and warm showers has been one of the BEST parts. Being welcomed with open arms. Im devastated it's closing but I trust you have made the right decision.i hope it all works out. Thanks for your amazing work and don't let the bastards grind you down!x
There should be some way to eliminate people who are members but don't even bother to respond to messages. 
"I've donated money to WS in the past when asked, because I can't imagine cycle travelling without it and felt it's ok to pay for the platform.  I'd prefer the financial support remains donation-based, but think it's ok if there's a minimum required fee. Let's face it, I save tons of money by guesting (just like I as a host  save my guests money) apart from the fun and community aspects of WS).
I also use Couchsurfing. After CS started commercialising, I was convinced by some guests I hosted to try Trustroots. But my experience of 2years was that TR guests and hosts weren't reliable. After several disappointments (hosts didn't reply, guests didn't show up) I basically dropped it. So I stuck to CS in the free version."
I'm totally with you ! You're making the right choice :) I've been thinking about creating a platform like warmshower for a while now, but with more recent technologies and modern interfaces (I'm CS engineering student in France) I'll send you a message on gitter, I would like to contribute to this new project!
Would be great if  you do it...you have all my gratitude !! :-). I can donate a bit to the project
Thanks for your great job

No
I found the app not user friendly.
"I have not be aware of the trouble . Who have to pay the fee ?
It's sad to see every selfmade community turn in a business"
Great ideas start with a few great people! 
We hope to have news in a near future 😊
I think Warmshowers is awesome
Thank you very much guys! 
just thank them and ask them not to lower their arms.  that there are many of us who believe that this is the way
Take care and never give up!
I am glad that there are still people out there who do something for a community and don't want to get rich doing it. Keep it up, guys!!! 
Nein
"I appreciate your honesty and your work. I dislike when free online plateformes about exchange (carsharing, couchsurfing) tend to become a business. However, I'd up for paying a reasonnable price per year to support the community (20€ is in my opinion absolutely ok) and finance the work behind.
Thank you!"
I will wait to see what will come up
Je ne parle pas anglais et votre nouvelle version m'empêche de rester sur votre plateforme.

Thanks for all your past efforts
Its so sad to hear that you had such a wonderful idea with this app and as soon as money gets involved people go crazy and forget the idea behind it. I loved using warmshowers during my travels but most of all because of the people I met. I really cross my fingers that there will be a similiar app soon but without people who don't share the idea. Good luck!! 
No
Go on. Take courage!
Thanke You so mutch for you great work. and good energie for the next Projekt

Thanks for all this years of work

Please go on. You are on the right way.

I'm happy to pay an annual fee for the service, particularly if it helps keep the system up to date. 
This app is really cool. Please don't give up.
Please come back quickly !!
Thaaank you!
Good job with the app. Hope a new free and frendly
Keep up the good work, guys! Your steadfastness is greatly appreciated.
congrats to create a newplatform! you will make it
I'll miss warm showers
I think it's a very good idea to allow the travellers to share their location during the trip so they could give a support, hints, recommend places to spend the night, etc. each to other (sorry for my speech XD)
Yeah good luck, I really hope it works out for you guys, let me know when you've created something!
It's great that there are still idealistic people around :) Lots of love! <3
A similar effort called bewelcome.org was organized in response to similar problems at couchsurfing.org. It is up and running but doesn't appear to have reached the size necessary to be effective. Instead of an alternative,  you might encourage people to join both, so as not to dilute the already small number of people willing to take part in this type of exchange.
Thank you so much for all the amazing work you did !!! I've met amazing people through warmshowers and please please please don't give up on us, we won't give up on you !!
It seems there is a US bias. Good luck!
I wish you luck! I have seen no mention of this circle on any of the main touring websites/fora.  
I can't understand why people are 7nhappy with Warmshowers. I would use a comparable system as well as Warmshowers, but have no reason to leave it. 
I don't fully understand what is going on, which specific changes there have been in the past years. 
Nice idea guys thanks
Ni idea 
I think it's a reasonable to expect that an organisation like this will need some sort of financial contribution but it seems that the app requires even hosts to pay which I think is ridiculous. Have not used the new app as yet because it is currently locking me out but I'm not sure if it's any improvement on the old 1.
Gracias mientras fue posible 
Facebook is a platform that I have a strong negative feelings towards. I have no intention of joining anything based on or associated with it.
No
Try to avoid confusion with warm showers
"Sorry about the development at Warmshowers leadership. I have a similar experience in the NGO I worked for all my life. (I founded a new charity last year). 
Narcissistic leaders and psychopaths destroy a lot of good ideas, business and organizations."
No
I'm software developer and would like to help
Sometimes, I get the notifications late, so I answer late to the hosts.
Absolutely great that you already started this! Will heavily promote it among my friends.
I do not like the idea of using a FB group, so I cannot join for that reason.
I'm a hard-core open source engineer, but more of a systems guy than UI.  Not sure how I can help.
You rock!
"I'm looking forward to hear from you and If you need a logo or graphic designs , I'd be glad to offer one
www.archidancecher.com "
Yes, I'd liké share with you
I think it is very important to have a support network for bicycle travelers, and I hope that it will continue to exist
there is nothing wrong with taking a fee for using any services like a platform and an app as long as it is fair. e.g. $ 5,- to buy (not rent) an app or a yearly member fee of e.g. $ 5,- incl. an app.
Stay strong! 
Nothing else matter. Just continue you are great!
Not at the moment 
More Focus on Europe!
Something for meet people Who take the same road
I think in the spirit of community, making grow existing communities is far better than splitting people in many different logins (actually as this was that I lost my WS account once). Also be no so eurocentrist. Many people can travel its one way, and also be offline in many places for long-term. So anything you will do, try to not ban people if they are not a always-connected zombie. (even if a year it would look a reasonable lapse, it is not. Life of a lifetime traveler could be out of some borders, even time.). 
Ja
good luck :) I join the Fb group so no need email ...  
Keep up The good work! 
Wish you all the best! Thanks for setting up a new non-profit organization for bikers.
"I'm concerned about funding and keeping it from becoming a profit company like CouchSurfing, for example. How would this new platform do it? 
Anyway, thanks for this, I'm happy there's a group of resistance against the late moves of this community based apps, which are lately loosing the reason they were created for. "
warmshower slowly die coz of money.. free app with ads is i think the best choice, with of course possibility to add subscription. 
Pointing out from the start that hosting and being a guest is equally a  two  way thing..
Thanks 
No
Keep on the good work
i encourage you to go ahead. i am willing to help setting things up - but not programming.
I left warm showers 2 years ago as my "guests" weren't following the rules. It was a shame as I meet some really interesting and entertaining people.
What
I don’t like that warmshowers.org demands a fee to use the app. I understand the need for a  donation drive from time to time, but not the fee system that has a very different value depending on where you live. 
your doing a terrific job, keep it up the community will be with you. 
Thanks for your job!!! 
Don't know 
Why you are doing this? The system was perfect.
May the force be with you!

The warmshower concept has been good for me and you have already said it all about its benefits.   Warmshower website not secure. 
Can't wait for you guys to be back!
Good luck with the new project, I will help you if I have the chance.

Many thanks
Thanks for develop a new app, unfortunality i am not able to help with IT skills but i am able to donate, not that much but at least i little bit!
Would you like to join Cycle Planet? I've shared a message on https://gitter.im/we-love-bicycles/community
Great, that you are working in that!  Thanks.
Great work
Thank you guys

I'm excited to see where this project goes, since I heard WarmShowers was great back in the day.
There are many negative comments on the Internet about how warmshowers has gone downhill since the tattooed creature took it over.
Thank you for your energy

Thanks for your work! I think it would be nice to have a tool for groups there. So that you could plan a trip and people who also wanne go there can join or the possibility to see if someone is also doing a trip near by ( but I gues that is not so easy to develop)

Everyhing must bé opensource
"I first learned about WarmShowers at a presentation for knitters in Exeter,  UK. I was inspired but also concerned by one experience of the presenter. So I'm concerned about safety when travelling alone. 
At the same time, I'm very put off by the sudden change in concept and fee.
Do you have any comments? "
I value open source apps, if you can keep the app open source that would be good.
It's a great platform. I'm sad to see it go. 
Merci a tous les développeurs de la première versions je pense qu'on va être nombreux à vous suivre sur la nouvelle plate-forme bonne chance à vous 
keep going for openness and transparency
get some inspiration from HipCamp
Go !
Courage and many thanks to you all
Obviously the app needs to be paid for. I would be happy to support through donation, or a one off fee, but less happy to pay a subscription.
I wish I can help. You are amazing guys. Thanks for saving the spirit of WS!
I like your attitude! Can I help?
I appreciate what you're doing! I was a regular supporter of warm showers, and admirer of the mission, but could not justify the excessive costs of membership. 
Not host People just booking and looping for à  for a free hostel, but want to share travel expérience 
Thank you for all you do!
Thank you for all of the work you've done,  and for this new work!
I have loved my experiences with using this platform and hope it can continue!
Tut mir leid, dass ihr nicht mehr zufrieden seid. Ich habe bisher eigentlich nur positive Erfahrungen mit WS gemacht, als Gast und Gastgeber. 
Thank you for Spur time and commitment! 
Send push notifications rather than relying on noticing an email from someone needing a place to stay.
"I would do another survey, but, designed to find out the DEFICIENCIES of the previous app... and the deficiencies of other apps.  for example Kamoot is a great cycling app, that lets you plan multiday trips, but boy does it chew through a battery. Warm showers didn't overlap in functionality, but it SHOULD HAVE. it should not only be about finding hosts, but also serve as the hub for all the things a cyclist needs on a trip...host-fnding, route planning, turn by turn directions, statistics tracking, community platform, trip reports, ...I would even suggest that it should have it's own custom OS designed specially for preserving battery while touring.  like Kamoot, there are many separate apps out there that cyclists use for different purposes... can they be integrated?? or can we look at them and decide what we can do better? are there functions that none of those apps have, like an SOS alert? if you get a broken part in the middle of nowhere, an SOS button with an alert note could trigger a blanket alert to all nearby members: 
SOS| NOTE: bent rim, no injury   DISTANCE: 10 miles   ETA: 11 minutes away [ACCEPT] 
if nobody responds, the alert can continually escalate to more desperate levels. on the traveler end, triggering an SOS should also return search results for nearest bike shops. being a community is what makes this function possible, so it should be set up with the intent to grow an interactive community beyond being only a list of active hosts by integrating a service like Discord, zoom, etc"
I have appreciated the opportunity to use Warm Showers when cycle touring, and I have enjoyed hosting fellow cycle tourists. Kudos to you for trying to keep a service such as this alive!
You re survey is a really good idea. I think democracy in such community is very important.
I super appreciate your efforts of running a non commercial app. Thx!
Good luck
Yassss make a new app. Free is always nice
Don't charge too much if at all.
I'm a developer and a bit busy for the next couple months but have been thinking about trying to help with warm showers for a while now, but would much rather help with this!
No
I am a web developer (Java,  Spring Boot,  python) doing mostly backend but also a little bit of frontend. Additionally  I have knowledge about hosting web stuff on linux machines as well as kubernetes. So if you need any help rebuilding something new, contact me 😉
Look forward to hearing the updates, good luck
Very glad with your initiative. The way Warmshowers was going, was bothering me for a while now... Glad I'm not just being a naive world-peace-dreamer 😏 Just be sure to keep the 'reviews' in the new system!
I don't mind the fee at its current level, as long as it's needed to cover the costs. But I wouldn't like my hospitality to be sold by others as a commercial product 
Good luck! :) 
Keep it up :) 
Keep a free application and work with donation system if necessary. 
I think It's better to change nothing. If you need you can add advertisement on the site
"I would think the main thing would be to somehow assure gues that the person is staying with has been vetted through some type of process like Airbnb or houseitters.com so they can feel more secure when leaving on a trip. Something that the guests would know that at the very least the person that there being a guest of would be accountable or held accountable for anything they did in a legal way
"
Good luck with your new group.
Searching with a map is the best
Go ahead, I hate things changing from open source to commercial organisation 
Thanks
I've had the app for ages but never tried it because of the paywall. That's meant I free camp and spend much less time in towns, and more on trails. Which is not necessarily bad I suppose. The point is, having to spend a little money can be OK. But it would be good to always be able to try the experience for free first. 
"warmshowers is too focused on overnight stays. In my cycle touring days I had tent, sleepingbag, cooking gear ... with me (all touring cyclists did) - so finding a place to sleep was never a problem. But I lacked showers, drinking water, and sometimes a washing machine.
I tried to be a ""host"" that  offers only showers, water and repair help/tools - but warmshowers.org somehow would not let me (insisting that I offer overnight stays). So I'm basically constantly marked unavailable, even though I would happily provide cyclists a shower or just a cup of tea. Warmshowers is not at all about warm showers, but about being a cheap alternative to AirBnB, which is kind of sad."
I think it's great of you guys doing this step and wish you all the best! may you always have the wind in your back and never a punctured tire ;) 
Please be an inclusive organisation, don't exclude people in a wheelchair who roll or handcycle the world.
I've been a member for over 25 years - since the list was just a text file. I used to tour a lot, but not lately. I am essentially only a host.
I never had the chance to join the community, because I was not still sure about my touring plans and was thinking about paying the 20 dollars when I was shure what I wanted to do. So sadly I have not been able to be part if the community yet. :( But I would be more than happy to join in something new!
Thank you for the great experiences you made possible.
Not aware of the corporate "take over of WS.  Also, I wonder how you got my email info?  Seems a bit strange.
Keep on acting congratulations
We are very happy that there is an alternative. And peoplellike you to spent time for this.
I'll be delighted to support you in the adventure. 
Love
I think this is a great idea. When I saw that a membership would have to be paid, I only saw that as creating new problems and not solving the "problems" it suggested (I didn't see those problems). I didn't know how the community was going to keep going as it was, but your message through the old app is definitely a good idea, best way to reach the most people!
I fear warmshowers is going the direction of couch surfing and will be limited in functionality unless paying. 
Thanks 
Merci pour tout ce que vous avez créé
Your text also in german
I really appreciate what you did with the Warm Showers app. It was well organized and easy to follow. I appreciate that you are trying to get back to it's roots.
It should be free so anyone, rich or poor can join. Free and not commercial. 
"Wish you all the best
"
The paid app really turned me off.  I wish it was funded by ads, like maybe bike shops where you currently are.  That would help anyway, if the ads told me where the shops were I know where to go.
Good luck guys!
Thank you!
I am very surprised about your message and I don't see into the organisation of Warmshowers. I am also upset about the costs of the new app knowing however that good software has its price. I would prefer to see you collaborating with the board of Warmshowers even if it seems difficult. It seems inconceivable to me to see the great mass moving away from warmshowers.

Thanks for not giving up! 
Good luck and thx
WS hosts are not reliable. A better system for locating reliable hosts is needed. 
I would like to get Updates about your projekt
we would like to get updates about your plans & projects
I have enjoyed both hosting and touring using warm showers. I have met nothing but wonderful people With  A sense of adventure
Source code must be open. That's important.

Good luck, hope it works out.
Covid has really limited the number of active hosts, so I hope the pandemic continues to improve otherwise your new platform might not do so well. 
Good luck!
Thanks!
Keep courage! Warmshower was the best for travelling by bicycle. Thank you for all your effort!!
Love and Luck in your New adventure. We undestand and support your move.
We miss the support as long distance cyclists looking for connections and hot showers! 
I want to keep my data from warmshowers like contacts. I still want warmshowers, no changes
Thanks
Will the official web page Warmshowers stop to exist? I don't quite understand it.
Everybody I know has the same opinion about WS as it is now. You can't sell everything...kindness, friendship, empathy...those things are not for sale
Good luck.  I am sorry to learn of strife but it is always a sign of passion where volunteers are involved.
we have missed having overseas travellers in new zealand, 
I think a great addition to your new platform would be an option for someone who would like to host (but can't) to offer a cycle tour of the town...or a way to offer traveling cyclists other type of support in addition to (or in place of) a place to stay.
BIKEforNight
Not yet 
D'ont now
Guys, what about all our contacts from WS? Is this now the time to save all of this info? I surely say that sometimes I spend time.reading the reviews I gave/received and that beings me back memories of people I have met during this years enjoying this beautiful platform. Please, don't close this door!!!

Muchas gracias
I had some wunderfull warm meetings including my familie 
THANK YOU to do what you do you are incredible. MERCI merci merci ! Thanks to you I have mate such nice people, and took so many nice showers........ :D
The thing I hated most about the WS app was the fact that I had to pay to use it. :/ 
Thanks. I was able to successfully host a world traveler in my home who had survived a recent injurious automobile contact. 
Keep it up, it is an amazing initiative. Thanks you ! If you need an architect to help design and build travellers cabins ;)
Thanks for that wonderful website which helped us and opened so many doors along our trips 
You're doing important work.
None
I love WarmShowers ! I was so happy to discover it 10 years ago just 2 days before the very  beginning of my first big travel. Since then, we've never stopped to use it and now my young children love to host travellers and love to be hosted. Thank you for your work !
Thanks and good luck
Les échanges gratuits .
1st travel 2 adults 2 children 2012. After 4 months we heard about WS. A few weeks later 1st request by terrible rain. 1 month later 2nd request by northwind, then 3rd by snow 😄 we falled in love with the idea of Warmshowers!!! Arriving at home after 7 months on the road, before opening the door we first wrote we were able to host 😁
"Hi There,
Difficult for me to answer all your questions for me as i have used warmshower app in only on trip.
But il want to say that i love your principle and you have all my support to carry on something on that way."
At 83 my touring days are over but I would still like to host guests from overseas
Good Luck! Happy to hear that you didn't lost faith in fair development. 
"Good luck, we'll be with you. 
Do you need any support?"
thanks y'all! much respect. peace
A host should NOT have to pay for an app...the org depends on the hosts!
I really miss the exchange and the easiness on getting to know people that love bikpacking
It IS very practical when WE CAN have Access to the hosts téléphone number, it helps when WE need a Quick response, traveling whith children myself, it's sometimes hard to plan a Long Time ahead where we'll be sleeping.
I really hope it's going to work ! Plus these Covid restrictions are a pita.
Thanks for the initiative !
I like the idea of a fresh new project, please keep me updated and if i can help somehow, let me know
Go go go !
Hope to see you back
good luck

I am socially inept and don't want to engage too much with travellers or hosts!   Perhaps there are others like me, that just want accomodation or to offer it but not the social side.
Thank you for so far 
Thank you for working on this! Do you know Coopcycle? They're building an open-source platform for delivery on bicycle. They might be good friends in this! 
You rock trying to rebuild from scratch. You are the Telegram of my WhatsApp. Cheers
De très belles rencontres  grâce à warmshower et toujours l'occasion de partager une bonne soirée.  Se retrouver autour d'une même passion dans un climat de confiance totale.
I've only used warmshowers 2 times. 1 as a host and one as traveler. So i didn't really see changes myself but after reading the while story i Just wanna say thank you for this values you stand for! Thank you and the best luck of building out a respective community.
As a host I strongly prefer the verification aspects (credit card, address, etc...) of couchsurfing of guests.  As a guest I would prefer it...
Ii have never stayed at a Warm Showers (yet) but we hosted do many. I usually stay in tent.
Keep up!! 
To me it is impotant, that the app is open source, google free and uses open street map
Keep going ! 
Hope to get to use as host/ guest in not to distant future
Nope. Have an amazing day
I'll be waiting for the new app to join!
Good luck! Keep up the good work!

"I would like to stay on a free platform like this. It would be great if we had the chance to merge our profiles or to copy/paste them. While still keeping the original.
I would not use a paid service app, where strangers make profit of me hosting cyclists or others hosting me. If I want someone else to gain money for hosting I may also go to Airbnb

"Moving to a fee based system seemed to be both shooting oneself in the foot and is totally repugnant.
Whilst the fee may be fine for those in first world economies, it totally undermines the ability and willingness of hosts in some of the more challenging locations to assist. 
Places where hosts are ever so much more important. "

"please, find a way ro ensure people is really active on the plaftform. For example reducing the scoring of hosts when not answering to a request in a couple of houra ( or a day or a week, but I would be very severe on this ). Or also notify the guest that his/her message has not been read in the last hours so he/she can remember who is not a reliable host.
also create a search woth filters to select only people that answers to messages or has a high score."
This all seems interesting. I'm sorry there was shotty drama at warmshowers and I look forward to seeing what happens from here. Keep me informed!

fancy names are silly, warmshowers are an example - what if someone has a bathtube, or no water - would you reject this if it was the only option in town? no. it's about offering a place to stay. whatever else is added value. Germans have a community like this - DachGaber.de its very dated, run by same person (one person == less issues) from the get go, the community works mostly by mail and phone than internet, but it works, no fancypantsy apps,socializing,debates.. but IT JUST WORKS FFS.

We really had solely positive experiences with warm showers so far as guests as well as hosts. 
Start quickly.

Bonne chance !
If the community is to small, it makes it much harder to plan a route that makes use of this sort of resource.
Incorporate a Twitter like feature in the app so that former and future hosts and travelers can stay connected in an easy way. It would help with building trust in the community. Please start a Twitter account for those of us who are not on Facebook
A bit worried how you get the people from warmshowers to change to another platform 
Go on ! 😉 
I've been a member of WS since 2004. I see the changes, grass roots getting paved. Change happens. While always adapting (like on tour) maybe membership to both/all groups will keep options open!

I used trust roots at the beginning of the project and it used to work quite well, but since 3 years I never get any answers, ever... I think a lot of people there are not motivated, just... I don't know why they subscribed. 
AS a lambda host and guest, the "politics" of it is not relevant. If it gets the job done (make hosts and guests meet) it's fine. "Open" is a means to an end, not and end in itself.

For many years I have hosted & enjoyed meeting cyclists travelling through NZ. I have cycle toured Europe & UK .... on & never once called upon others for hospitality, camping or used hostels.

I learned about Warm Showers reading/watching a cycle touring blog and thought that is great that you can tent or stay somewhere safe, hospitable, and cheap. The opportunity to make friends with locals and get the scope on your route, area highlights, food is certainly a plus!

The current website is clunky. Searching for hosts always seems to be more complicated than it needs to be and the timed pop up windows for notifications is annoying. If I'm near stranded somewhere, with a low battery, I need it to work fast and efficient. 
Good luck!
You cool guys
Merci pour votre engagement !

"Then we've used WS many never answer. 
Also being a host, many guests don't take the time to leave a review. Seriously. It's the least they can do. "
I have been getting emails since the warmshowers site ceased to function from a person claiming to operate the site.. I've chatted. They assume my ability to interact is unchanged. I am blocked from editing or minimizing my profile and status. I suspect my previous settings are still live to others. Am I being shadow banned by a report from a resentful local homeless gambling addict I declined to allow access to my home?
Hang on!
Please let me know your new platform tolgaayzit@gmail.com
Don’t give up!
"It's tough to establish something, an alternative to a platform which already exists. Competitors to FB are still niche, Whatsapp dominates over all other messengers. If something is really messed up like with Couchsurfing, then chances are higher people move on. But to where? There are some platforms but none as strong and widely known as Couchsurfing.
Same with warmshowers. Right now it's still working somehow, so people will most likely stay. But I spread your word amongst all my WS hosts and in various FB groups. Let's see. 
A new platform should be not too overwhelming. Warmshowers was a hospitality platform and not really a digital social network one. It had one aim IMO - bringing hosts and travellers together. Interaction was painful and only via message. This basic function and appearance was somewhat charming and horrible at the same time. 
Merging a Facebook styled platform with WS would be kind of cool but maybe too much. "
Don't get to big.
Anything ı can
I am very supportive of creating a new alternative to WS, that is not based on profit.
No 
Thank you for being a part of Warmshowers and trying to keep its original values alive! It's been such an incredible resource to us and we've loved hosting and being guests all across the world.
Great job team 👍

The idea of paying a fee is ridiculous. If anyone is making money from it, it's because of the generosity of the hosts. My ability to host should do no more than pay for the website hosting and perhaps something for any costs at most. I would only be interested in the bicycle touring community, I don't want it expanded to other groups.

Stay in touch. I have only recently begun hosting bikers.... they approached me independently.  I never saw email from WS telling me someone was looking.
My experiences with hosting haven't all been good, which has sometimes made me wonder about quitting hosting altogether
Thank you for your hard work
So far, I only hosted guests. Next year I will start traveling and get to know the other side... 😉
Wrote a review for the new app to warn users. I only found out because I couldn't log in and downloaded the old app. Maybe you can write the text from there in the Google play description so more people would see what's going on?
Thanks so much 
Muchas gracias por todo lo que hace n para que viajar sea un derecho y no un negocio
I respect you guys, that you start from the scratch. There are some things, that you can not buy for money and it motivates me, to see that Not the whole world Is f***ed Up! Thanks for that!
I like youre initiative
I joined couchsurfing before warmshowers, and the reason why ws was so good (I gave up on cs after a while), was because everyone there were cyslists. We were from all walks of life but tourers share the same spirit and so trust was very high. CS has lots of random people who were weird/opportunistic/creepy and I gave up. I felt that ws was, as it goes on, becoming more random. Being open is good though, so I suggest having more fields to share details esp. about cycling so we can make decisions about who to host/stay with. Just my opinion. 
"- Fix your message in the legacy app. It links to websites that are down. Like https://openhospitalitynetwork.github.io/. It's not inspiring confidence. 
- with all due respect to good dev practices, a good product is not necessarily build with good code. It's great to publish your domain driven data model. But if this is it, then it's not a cycle tourer oriented community. Try to solve people problems instead of trying to write good code.  Or worse, trying to build a meta hospitality platform that will never have any user. There's enough good code of utopian projects with 0 user out there on GitHub. Learn about MVPs. Scrap WS data and see if you can migrate part of the community. Offer more convenience than WS.org. Remember why former users are pissed with WS (it's not just you) and do offer a solution for that. Learn why former users still use WS and try to replicate it. Learn from the failures of the dozen projects trying to reinvent couchsurfing.org after they got VC money. Remember that sadly most users like convenience more than security, data privacy, decentralized architectures, data ownership, etc. These things come after real world problems being solved. "

Hope this builds constructively, based on a large WS developers experience, though
I have had tooooo many requests at very short notice.  So I'm changing my strategy 
Experiences from Couchsurfing have shown, that building alternative platforms will never bring as many members as before, so people will still use the old platform if the benefits are not way bigger.

I'm new on the platform and I don't know much about how it works (and use to work)

I'd love for the platform to support LGBTQ, BIPOC, and disabled cyclists specifically in some way. Either thru vetting or filtering or reviews. 
Love you all. 
"I am not against paying for such a meaningful service. I understand your opinion on inclusivity, but I am happily donating to platforms like this because it means the world to me. It's not a bad thing to look for sources of income from the community, that could make life just a bit easier.

This community will be forever missed. It ment so much too me and the respite it created for so many tired cycle tourists 
"I would like it to be mandatory that guest carry a sheet sleeping bag liner in the traditional UK  YHA style.  I am fed up of people who are fit and healthy declining to carry any luggage  and expecting me to deal with laundry.  I am on a popular cycle route. They think that they are o h so tough because they can cycle 100 miles a day but they are such weak selfish people they expect total hotel service for free.   Mysheet bag weighs 180g   https://www.terrevistatrails.com/jag-bag-deluxe.html
My father purchased my first from the Youth Hostels Association in 1973, i am now on my third. It is always with me becasue it allows you to sleep without causing laundry. It weighs half a can of beer. It is little larger than my sunglasses.
   The budget option in these times of inflation is to have a single dubvet cover  available from a charity upcycling shop for two pounds. They can climb inside.
    We could even go frther and ask for a sleeping bag appropriate to climeate so that expectation of host is that they supply  a space to put sleeping bag and a toilet and water supply- anything else being a  joyful bonus.
You say that you have issues with organiszation, but i have had no issue with them apart from the odd popup suggesting a donation. And i have donated even thoufgh its har d to find a ""Member"" to host me.
We are so committed that we built and outddor shower and hired a portable porcelain flush toilet unit to offer facilities during covid becasue we realised that people needed to get out and about.
To me it would be better if you included hikers as Welcome to mygarden does.  If you are joining forces with welcome to my garden please encourage them to adopt profiles and feedback.

I hope you can keep this organization going.

Just to give a thanks for tour efforts
I understand your position by reading your statement about the backoffice of Warmshower governance. But the strength of Warmshower is the number of users and the trust in the community. If you create a new platform, I'm afraid that you will lose these benefits or that you will need time to regain it... As traveler, I need to find as soon as possible a place to stay. So if hosts on warmshower.org are more reactive than hosts on another platform, I will use it!

This is no fault of warmshowers but I'd like to see a strict policy apply to hosting i .e if you don't reply to a guest request then you should no longer be allowed to host. When I cycled in Japan I sent requests to hosts. I got 1 reply only out of 10. I gave several months notice, mentioned I spoke the language and have cycled in Japan before. I don't care whether they say yes or no- I just want a reply so I can plan my accommodation!
Good idea. Carry on!
