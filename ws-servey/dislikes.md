# What do you miss from WarmShowers.org?

most requests are copy pased
"well, all the reasons you mention! very upset with the direction it went.
I would enjoy it if the platform had democratic governance features built-in, and also federated, I'll write a bit about that in the other box..."
The spirit
 The ability to meet like-minded folks of all denominations, get useful info., local and otherwise. 
"App; controlling about inactive members (no answees since months and years, profiles without useful infortmation,... 
It seems they want a huge amount of members more than active members..."

I'm not going to pay, have only hosted, never been a guest. (Will definitely change)
That some users delete their account if their inactive. To wait weeks or mo more is too long

Nothing
A platform and a app that works well. We are now traveling since 13 months by bicycle and we missed so many hosts because they saw the message too late.

Nothing. It seems fair to me to participate financially to help the system work. I use to donate every year. Will switch from donation to app annual fee...

"Many hosts do not reply in my experience. Ive only received a request for a stay three times, but once somehow the request never came through. I miss a clear notification of messages. 
That might be a reason why some hosts do not reply.
"
Gratuité
It being free to all
It would ne nice to have some filters that you could put on when searching for host. Sometimes theres so many options in bigger cities :D but the bigger problem was that I didnt get any notofications for new messages. Maybe also some navigation option to host would be cool.          
Anything :( 
Nothing
Sometimes the telephone numbers  are not actual
"Sometimes it takes too long for having an answer on a request for hosting and do you have to plan in advance too much, which makes the trip not flexible anymore.

New interface. The map is good but the rest is a bit "old" and new generation of riders don't easily trust those old apps

I want those messages that arrive at any moment!  Hey hi, I'm passing through your city, can I stay at your place?
I understand the need to charge, but I have offered to 50 cyclists and only stayed with two: how about charging a minimum fee for those who don't offer? Also I would love to be able to add wild camping spots,cheap accom&restaurants to the map.

Not sure how it's really working at the moment (COVID has been restricting my travels). Privatisation and commercialisation of phone app is certainly an involution from the original Warmshowers spirit.

I havent used it yet. I am planning a trip with my newly converted electric bike.
I was used to it, it was simple with a lot of easygoing peolple.
La fluidité de l'interface entre site/smartphone et + de simplicité entre les contacts par email/tel et plateforme web
Their email system has been regularly broken, missed hosts and guests that way for years :/ Afraid with the high sign up fee few people will still join, and I cannot really recommend it any more. Even worse, people who just want to host will disappear, with anyone from outside western countries. Communication about the new app was awful, just like CS ...
I haven't used it for a while due to the pandemic.

paiement, non inclusif,application android
Ich mag diese vielen Profile nicht, die sich nur anmelden um kostenlos durch die Welt zu Touren, ohne selbst je als Host fungiert zu haben. Wir haben in unserem Profil den Hinweis,  dass wir nur Gäste aufnehmen, die selbst auch bereits als Host fungiert haben
?
I didnt know that WS was now going into this pretty bad direction. I dislike it and i wish that WS could be open and democratic without any capitalist mode.
Messages are not in my email box
It's availability
It's difficult to contact the hosts through the app. Just if they publish their phone number it's easy to contact.
I can't have it on my mobile
Not ruding

Everything if it's gone. It's the community of cyclists. You feel so much safer than couch surfing because everyone has a link in common. Cycling.
Openess, non-profit attitude
Honest and open development.
"A feature to publish a request for homestay in a whole area, like if you're in a big city, just ask if someone would like to meet you and show you around, and let them contact you :)
Also another idea that I think would be great, would be to have a map where people can pinpoint and indicate locations that are nice spots for wild camping, as well as facilities like toilets or access to water for example. That would be very nice, you could also use warmshowers and sharing the knowledge of other travelers even when no host is living around you !"
It is cluttered with everything EXCEPT a simple and reliable way to connect host and traveller. It is not that it "misses" anything, it is that it seems to try to be everything to everyone

Sometimes its hard to find a host because offen people do not repond or they just use it as a guest and never as a host. 
Easy and free way to connect with lots of people
Nothing really. Sometimes keeping it simple makes it better. A search option, messages and a map is just what I need. I liked it was run by volunteers, although I understand money is needed to keep it on. I don't like what's happened to WarmShowers or CouchSurfing lately.

"I love warmshowers, I am so grateful for meeting everyone. 
I think warmshowers could have been more user-friendly. To put it in simple words: less is more. Actually I think trust roots is a great community and feels simple to use.
In a new app: 
I would love to get pop-up notifications on my phone when I get a request, a message, etc. That was the main issue during my tour and many hosts also found it annoying.
It's great to see the last time a user was online, so the possibility of getting an answer was much higher.
Maybe a map could show who is on tour right now, who is taking a break and who is planning a trip.
Also symbols could work like communities on trust roots. Example: a hammer for people who know how to fix a broken bike.

An active attempt to include non white and especially non western people into the community. Mostly if outside of Europe it is only expads. I think this is really a missed chance and it would be super nice to include some anti racism mechanisms ti make that possible, consulting with different groups in different countries and with different backgrounds what their needs may be, stuff like that. Sometimes touring cycling and its community feels somewhat colonial :/
I guess the free app that is supposed to be going away. 
The old way, when it was for everyone, not a club from rich countries

I'm not sure. To be honest I have not used this app since last year and had no problems with it or an issue.
I haven't noticed the changes.
I would've liked to try the app, but sadly I was too late. However I'm sure it was a great app, and it would've been a great way for travelers like me to find places to stay.
There are fewer and fewer low budget people using it. I miss them. The fees are pushing them out.
N/a
Yes
It's not free for new users
the app and website changed for the worse in the 2017 or 2018 update. in 2016 it was scrappy but got the job done.
I honestly never used it much myself, but I liked the idea of it and didn't mind donating to help keep it alive for others to use now, or myself in the future
In the past I have had a few "cyclists" that have used this service that are really not cycle touring but rather using Warm Showers as a place where they can get free accommodations for an extended period of time. 
"An floss app, i could get on fdroid.

Too new to the app. I dont remember the old ways
There was a change recently where the app and website stopped working the same as each other. The situation with the app developers leaving the project and the factors that led them to feel the need to do so are a shame
People who respected it and used it appropriately not just signed up to get but also to give. Also miss the forums
It was free and open!! I miss actually using it. I'm not going to use it anymore because few people will want to be on it because now guests have to pay.
Good app to conntact host when on the road
The freedom. The idea of global solidarity. Knowing that it's based on mutual solidarity and the wish to just help out a traveller. It doesn't have to become a booking.com for cyclists...
In the last year I have not been active in the platform due to Corona. Before that I didn't notice any changes. As far as I know last time we used it in the USA, we did not have to pay anything. The app could be better tho

I think it moved from warm showers to a pure accommodation service, and the basic idea got somewhat lost (but maybe I got the basic idea wrong, being misled by the name).
Hosting - COVID pretty much ended that ...

To be for free and accessible for everyone
the application is not friendly.  no filter.  the map is not clear
Maybe an interest-based way of searching for host
Not enough active users to be useful. 
When I traveled in 2019, first time with warmshowers I missed an easy way (app) for connecting with people also in a slow internet connection in the country side.

More elements useful for cyclists on that we could decide to display on the map or not. Such as bike shops, spots to get water, camping spots, laundry places etc... 
chance to meet people and guest and host

For me is the most difficult check regularly if i got any message, i would need android app, where is easy to chat and the phone would give me know about new message. (maybe it's already possible?) i instal the app app again after one year.

I really don't understand why as a host I need to pay something. My contribution is already to give something to travellers
It used to be free
Since you removed all phone numbers from members, it doesn't work for me anymore. I can only contact by email and that works too slow. Or I have to plan a few days ahead, which is difficult, because I like to travel without too many plans.
I've been not using it as much as I'd like recently but I would say It's not as much from warmshowers than the people I think. Sometimes it's hard to gage if you can expect answers in certain areas. Not sure how it would be possible to have some sort of community enhancement, empowerment around traveling by bike and all the good times that can happen around that.

An easier interface on a smartphone! And even on the computer. Also, I joined warmshowers 7 years ago and never had to pay, but I hear new comers have to pay now. I find that sad. 
More map details and display of the hosts. The ability to get updated status on hosts ready or not to host. A ping system just to notify a host of our interest for a date

Connection with this community 
Haven't use it much so far 
The number of no replies from hosts I think have forgotten their return obligations or just lost interest.
I miss the ability to easily find hosts on a map
Culture. 
A place to have a place to live
the hospitality of the hosts and the energy of the travelers.
Maybe it would be nice if hosts from a certain city or region could post tips about what to see/ do, where to eat etc on a common page/ post

Great memories and connections, back when it worked properly, being able to host people (declined numbers), algorithm not working now.

It seems like it's a business now and not anymore a free exchange platform. Same development like couchsurfing and mitfahrgelegenheit.de. That makes me angry and sad!

its users are only "rich" people, who can afford the entry fee. All the others (I mean poor country's people) are excluded.
This was all news to me.

Nada.
It helped me when I needed the most
Free APP
More user friendly inbox and messaging system.
Easy travel and the people, exchange
a stable app, a community function, app with usability, app for free
I gave up on it 4-5 years ago. I depended on it when I toured by myself. I am a 72 year old female. I miss the safety it offered. I also miss the guests who brought great stories. After reading this info, things make more sense to me. I couldn't figure out what was happening. I just knew that people were volunteering their spaces to help other bikers, and then it not only got expensive, but the website got complicated for me. I bailed (with a heavy heart).
The hospitality of the host

Le nouveau WS est une honte
It would be neat to have a personal map with markers of everyone you've stayed with,  hosted or befriended 
Easy way to find people and send them a message.
Not community driven. Use Google map

Difficile de faire une recherche quand il y a beaucoup de personnes prêtes à accueillir... Temps de réponse des hébergeurs parfois long, ou même inexistant... 
I miss the personal aspect now that warm showers is more commercially orientated.

Fghhhy 
I have never stayed at a warm showers home, but was researching bike touring Maine and noticed that campgrounds charge $30-35 and even primitive sites are $15-22. So considering expense/day, it would be hard to spend less than $60-70/day for food and lodging.

Cleaning up hosts would be nice. There seem to be some inactive ones.
I didn't use it enough to have a real opinion on it 
All good apart from the paying app, the lack of regards for volunteers' work and the lack of transparency for finance. What I won't miss is the constant begging for donations spamming my mail.

I am grandfathered in so no fee. It has a corporate type feel now which I don't like. The old grass roots feeling is sort of gone. Would Roger Gravel be proud now? 
I miss that you can't really see on the map who is an actual member of the community and who just joined once quick because they heard they can sleep somewhere for free. It should be indicated if you actually love this kind of thing...

The original App. It was great while on tour - being able to access offline info from your favourite hosts while on the road. Free access to all - I'm concerned about the potential gaps in the database now given new members have to pay. 
Since a while activity of many users dropped (e.g. reply to messages, feedback, etc.). I guess it is related to the fact that there are now fees on the app...
Free app
Strangers are family and friends, let's keep it like that.
The ease of use and the increasing complexity of the system.

I didn't realise anything had changed. If you now have to pay that's stupid. I've only been hosting recently
The fact that it was free
Nice guests 
I miss Members who participate. I miss Members who answer missives. I miss genuine members who love bike touring and hosting.

Free app.
Was easy and clear. Felt welcomed as a host. No beggi g for money. Hosts pay a lot of out of pocket expenses to serve the bikers already. And happy to do so too.
They don't record all my responses
I was not really sure if I should pay the fee. Finally I paid... 
Simpler communication with gests and hosts
Nothing
"It was never organized well. From the profile to the messages and notifications. A well functioning app is the most important as that is what you're using on the way. 
- Privacy is very important, so everyone should be able whom to show his personal information.
- map should be based on the opencyclemap
- better rating system for hosts and riders as references are in my opinion more important than the actual description of a profile (I think there should also be an anonymous way for a rider to tag a host if there was a sexual interference)
- charging a few for riders (not for hosts) is fine but everything needs to be clear upfront and the user base & and user experience of the app needs to be good (compare for example with couchsurfing)"
nothing personally, but its future doesnt look bright (same story as hospitality club, couchsurfing)
Extrañaría no pode compartir experiencias y todo sería muy caro, no creo que todo tiene precio, es muy lindo ayudar y ser ayudado, es una nesecidad intrínseca del ser humano 
A more ergonomic interface. The current website and its messages management is cluggy. 
Ist should remain free. Finance trough advertisments or some crypto projects = create your own token, crowdfunding etc.
Community, trust, cultural exchange 
Working software. Software covered by donations and not having cycling money going into pockets of non cycling people (app stores, consultants, marketing, bicycle giveaways etc). A fast growing network. 
Rien

The community
The page sometimes doesn't work very well with me, f.e. when we travel as 3 persons I have to click on every single host to see if he accomodates so many people...
The app should allow us to upload our route. That way we could easily see the warmshowers avaliable along the route

I don't miss anything. It could be a bit more shiny though. More community engagement within. Maybe also creating a place to showcase your (current) trips, photos and such on your profile. In this way the platform and profiles can also be used for inspiration.
Open and transparent, nonprofit.

I find that some guests lately have totally different expectations on me as a host, but I only today foudn out the story behind the change of warmshowers
They're going down the same route as CS, and become more like this big cooperation that only focuses on profit. It's a shame, it loses that family and community feel this way.

Seems like a fair amount of inactive hosts listed. Yet, usually, they are spotted by their low response rates.

App not working

Forcing hosts to pay a subscription defeats the entire premise of the community. I might be willing to pay as a guest, but absolutely not as a host when I don't know anything about the guest. Min-bogglingly stupid decision by the board.

free and therefore interesting people 
Over the last 8 years as a host I had the impression of it to become more like a top down rather than a bottom up organisation. I know, for a bigger and bigger organisation there are more and more rules by law and less and less people who are willing to volunteer - the result a semi professional board which is responsable and an effect that is not aimed for.
