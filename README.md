# Federated Hospitality Exchange

We are trying to reclaim hospitality from exchange platforms back to human interactions.

We’d like to take community-first approach, followed by technology. But it’s also very infrastructure heavy piece, so technically, we’re trying to federate different already existing hospitality exchange platforms to make it easy for new ones to emerge and evolve to keep serving their communities' needs - not the other way around. We'd like new communities to freely form, grow and re-form and for that we need new generation of software, flexible enough to be able to follow them.

**hospitality platform**: a piece of software which connects travelers with those who want to host them. 

We envision platforms built around specific communities's characteristics, for bicycle touring community, slow-travellers, in different than English languages, for women or lgbtq only, gathering together families or vegan families. While they are independent and individual, they share common goal to connect travelers and hosts, and communicate with each other to better serve their communities.

In other words, we are trying to federate existing hospitality exchange platforms into one big full-of-variery community.

_Hospitality_ is an universal human phenomenon, practiced long before any software infrastructure existed. We can't imagine a platform like ours to fulfill it's goals if it was not open, free and transparent for everyone and forever. [Open source software](https://github.com/FediHospEx/fedihospex.github.io), [open finances](https://opencollective.com/fedihospex), open governance (don't know yet _exactly_ how to do that, we have some ideas/experiances and we promise to try our best). [Come help us!](#where-you-can-find-us)

## Who's involved in this? 

In the project are involved contributors to the platforms:
- [Open Alternative to WarmShowers.org](https://WarmShowers.bike)
- [Trustroots.org](https://Trustroots.org)
- [WelcomeToMyGarden.org](https://WelcomeToMyGarden.org) 
- [BeWelcome.org](https://BeWelcome.org)
- [CouchSurfing.org](https://CouchSurfing.org) (before it locked it’s community behind paywall)

Potentially also:
- [Couchers.org](https://Couchers.org)
- [CyclePlanet.org](https://CyclePlanet.org)


## Why are we doing this?

* We aim to solve the issue of centralized boards ending up with too much power and locking their own communities in a platform the members cannot influence or move away from without losing history (reputation and trust are very important for hospitality exchange), and access to accumulated over years hosts base.
* We hope to grow network of (active!) hosts reachable from any platform…
* … and flexibility to choose who, when and where we’d like to host
* We hope to increase diversity of platforms so that everyone can choose what fits them best
* We hope to increase security and be more inclusive and welcome new members from under-represented groups
* We hope to take off from existing platforms a burden of trying to fulfill needs of all without having a clear identity
* We hope to reduce the burden on developers maintaining the platforms to keep up-to-date in ever changing technology landscape


## What exactly would change?

1. *from* a few **platforms** without clear identity, competing with each other for users
   *to* the **bigger diversity of platforms with their own specific identity developed. Shared access to wide base of hosts** would relieve the burden on platforms to fulfill all needs and they would not fear of missing out since other needs would be covered by other platforms. One could then imagine platforms in other languages than English or dedicated to certain life choices (think of ecology or veganism)
   - easy deployment of new instance
   - self-hosting and managed-hosting options for communities

1. *from* **users** jumping between multiple accounts, one for each platform
   *to* **single account and one search to query all platforms and find closest hosts among all of them**
   - single sign-on (cross platform identity)
   - visibility of existence of users across platforms (aggregated per location, no individual hosts)
   - linked accounts / guest account based on profile from the primary platform to reach out to users of the other platform
   - visibility of users across platforms (protocol what to include: location in 5km radius, username, …)
   - communication across platforms (aka matrix, ActivityPub)
   - a map with hosts from other federated communities

1. *from* **communities** locked in silos platforms with self-selected boards not representing communities values any more 
   *to* **freedom to be on a platform of their choice, with variety of platforms existing, variety of governance, variety of communities to be part of while being part of wider network with many hosts available**
   - easy account migration between instances (nomadic identity)
   - discoverability of accounts (ex. usernames with platform prefixes)

1. *from* **users** from underrepresented groups (non-english speakers, women, lgbtq, …) hesitating to participate because of fear of unsafe interactions
   *to* **the community, where everyone feels welcome, can find their place and group where they belong to, feel safe and can fully express themselves. Full diversity of members from all sort of backgrounds and groups equally represented in the community.**

1. *from* **devs-maintainers** competing with time to keep up to date with ever changing technologies, tired with maintaining outdated platforms,
   *to* **new platforms emerging every now and then with fresh ideas, energy and tech stacks. This can be achieved by making it easy for new platforms to start based on already existing ones and evolve them freely.**

1. *from* **platforms** keeping hosts forever despite them being inactive and unresponsive
   *to* **only committed hosts participating in the network on their own rules and preferences.**

1. *from* **users** exchanging direct messages 
   *to* **indirect hosting requests**

   > I travel and publish: Who can host me? \
   > Everyone in the network can see it and someone answers: come over to my home, we’ll be waiting this evening for you.
   
   - the request includes everything needed to determine for who it is relevant: (a) expected location and radius (b) current location, direction and speed (c) …
